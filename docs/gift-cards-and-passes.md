# Gift Cards and Passes

Gift cards are a form of payment. Customers can purchase gift cards and then use it to buy tickets. Passes are 
different from gift cards in that they allow for tickets to be claimed at no cost during a certain time frame. 
Gift cards have no time frame.

## How Gift Cards Work
- You can create multiple denominations of gift cards, $50, $100 etc. under the "Gift Cards" menu option.
- When customer purchases a gift card they will get an email with a gift card code which they can apply when buying tickets.
- Gift cards never expire, and remaining balances can be used on subsequent purchases.
- Gift cards apply to all events under your account. You can optionally restrict the application of a gift card to a 
  category of products
- Customer buying gift cards pays service fees and taxes when purchasing the gift card.
- Customer using the gift card to buy tickets does not pay any service fee if gift card covers entire total; 
  if gift card does not cover entire total, service fee is applied.

## How Passes Work

- You can create a pass from the same screen you create a Gift Card. You must set a price for the pass and a 
  start/end date for when that pass is applicable.
- When customer purchases a pass they will get an email with a pass code which they can apply when buying tickets.
- The pass allows you to buy any tickets under your account during that time period for free. You can optionally 
  restrict the application of a pass to a category of products.
- Service fee is applied only when purchasing the pass. There is no service fee applied during purchase of tickets 
  with the pass (since the total will always be 0 as it's a pass).
- One caveat: As an example, avoid creating a pass for $20 which would be used on tickets which are on sale for $50 
  (that would be kind of odd anyway). Basically, keep the price of the pass higher than the tickets it will be used on.

## How do payouts work?

Both gift cards and passes are paid out immediately to the Stripe account. There is no "pay me later" option for them.
As soon as one is purchased, you will get a notification email and money will have already be transferred to your account.
