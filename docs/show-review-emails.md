# Show Review Emails

After every show anyone who bought tickets is sent an email asking them to provide comments and a rating about
the show and the comics. This email also contains links to comic socials.

This review is private and only seen by the comic and admin. It is not made available publicly.

## Controlling Emails

Go under Account Settings (click on your avatar) and you'll see options there to manage this email. You will see a
drag-and-drop email builder which you can use to optionally customize the email. 

You have three options in the dropdown there:

1. Don't send the email, which results in no email being sent.
2. Send the default email which only contains comic socials and a 1-5 star rating.
3. Send a custom email which you can craft. 

When you select the custom email option, the email you crafted in the email-builder is sent to the customer.

Note that when using the custom option, the app will force you to put the words *RATINGS_WIDGET* somewhere in your
email. That part will be replaced in the email with the comic socials and ratings options described earlier.

## Subject of Email

When using the "default" option, the subject of the email is "Did you enjoy the show?".  When customizing the email
be sure to specify a subject yourself.
