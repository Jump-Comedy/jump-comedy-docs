# Payouts

There are three ways to collect the money from orders. You can pick these when creating an event.

## Pay out every order

Every order is immediately paid to your Stripe account. For orders processed via PayPal, immediate payment isn't currently possible
so those orders will be paid out 2-3 days after the show.

## Pay once at the end

Jump will automatically pay out all orders 3 days after the event ends. You will get an email notification when this happens.

As an example, if you have an event on Saturday night you'll get paid by Wednesday.

## Manual payouts

You can hold all payments and coordinate with Jump directly so we can cater to your needs. This may be useful for larger
payouts or international transfers.
