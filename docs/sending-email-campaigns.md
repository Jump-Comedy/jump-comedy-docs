# Sending Email Campaigns

You can send email campaigns to your audiences using the drag-and-drop email builder. This feature is located under
the "Campaigns" menu option.

## Filtering Target Audiences

There are four ways you can target audiences.

### 1. Send To Everyone

You can send the email blast to everyone on your mailing list. No exceptions. This email goes out to everybody.

### 2. Filter by City

You can filter subscribers based on city by checking off all the cities you would like the email to be sent to.

The subscriber's city is determined automatically based on their location when they place an order on Jump.

Subscribers who are on the list through other means (e.g, manual upload where the file has no city field) will have
their city field set to blank. To target these people, you can check off "Cities with no value" and the email will go
to them as well. If you don't check it, they will not receive an email.

### 3. Filter by Comic

If you specify comics on your shows on Jump, you have the ability to target subscribers who purchased tickets
to specific comics' shows. Simply check off the comic's name and only those customers will receive the email.

For customers who purchased tickets to shows where no comic was assigned to the show in Jump, you can select "Empty Comics field"
and they will receive an email as well. If you don't check it, only people who went to the checked off comic's shows will
receive an email.

It is strongly recommended that you add comics to shows to take advantage of this powerful feature.

*Note*: If you specify a Comic and City filter, the email will go to subscribers matching BOTH criteria (not just one).

### 4. Filter by Index

Sometimes you want to send an email to only part of your list, say 1/3rd. You can do this by specifying the subscriber indexes.

For example, if you hav a subscriber count of 100, you can enter "1" as the start position and "50" as the end position, and only
the first 50 subscribers will receive the email. Or you can use any other number between 1 and 100 in this example.
