# Sending Email Campaigns

You can send email campaigns to your audiences using the drag-and-drop email builder. This feature is located under
the "Campaigns" menu option.

## Filtering Target Audiences

There are five ways you can target audiences.

### 1. Send To Everyone

You can send the email blast to everyone on your mailing list. No exceptions. This email goes out to everybody.

### 2. Filter by City

You can filter subscribers based on city by selecting all the cities you would like the email to be sent to.

The subscriber's city is determined automatically based on their location when they place an order on Jump.

Subscribers who are on the list through other means (e.g, manual upload where the file has no city field) will have
their city field set to blank. The checkbox next to cities targets these people as well.

### 3. Filter by Comic

If you specify comics on your shows on Jump, you have the ability to target subscribers who purchased tickets
to specific comics' shows. Simply check off the comic's name and only those customers will receive the email.

It is strongly recommended that you add comics to shows to take advantage of this powerful feature.

### 4. Filter by Venue

You can target subscribers who bought tickets to a show at particular venues. 

*Note*: If you specify a combination of Comic/City/Venue filter, the email will go to subscribers matching ALL criteria (not just one).

### 4. Filter by Index

Sometimes you want to send an email to only part of your list, say 1/3rd. You can do this by specifying the subscriber indexes.

For example, if you hav a subscriber count of 100, you can enter "1" as the start position and "50" as the end position, and only
the first 50 subscribers will receive the email. Or you can use any other number between 1 and 100 in this example.


## Excluding Subscribers

You can exclude certain subscribers from receiving emails. There are two ways you can do this:

### 1. Exclude people who purchased tickets to specific shows

You can specify shows so that people who purchased tickets to those shows will be excluded from the campaign. This is
helpful if you are giving away free tickets but don't want to send the campaign to someone who already purchased tickets.

### 2. Exclude people who opened certain campaigns

You can specify campaigns so that people who opened those emails are excluded from the current campaign. This is 
helpful when you want to target people who haven't yet opened your initial email.
