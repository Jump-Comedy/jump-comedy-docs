# Event Reminder Emails

You can choose to send reminders for events 48 hours before the event when creating each show. A simple email will
be sent containing event name, timing and venue information to the customer.

## Event and Account-Level Settings

This setting can be configured at the show level or the account level under Account Settings. When enabling it at the
account level, any new event will be configured to sent reminder emails. Changing this setting has no impact on 
already created events.

The show-level setting overrides the account level setting.
