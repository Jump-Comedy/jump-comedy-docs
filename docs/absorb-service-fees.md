# Absorbing Service Fees

By default, service fees are passed to the customer.

You can change this by checking the "Absorb" checkbox next to the price for each show.

Here is an example with and without absorbing, and with and without charging taxes. Note that service fees
are always taxed regardless of whether you choose to collect taxes on the ticket price. 

This example is for a show in Vancouver where the tax rate is 5%.
