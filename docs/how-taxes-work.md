# How Taxes Work

By default, all events charge taxes based on the location of the venue where the event is being hosted.

There are two main tax settings which you can customize. 

## 1. Control at Event Level

When creating or editing an event, you can go under "Advanced Options" and choose whether to collect
taxes for this particular event. Checking it on will collect taxes. Checking it off will not.

## 2. Default Account Setting

Under Account Settings (click on your avatar) you will see an option to collect taxes for events
under that account. Checking this on will default any newly created event to collect taxes. Checking it
off will default any newly created events to not collect taxes. It has no impact on events already created.

Note that whether you decide to charge taxes or not, the service fee will always be taxable 
(this is a legal requirement for us and cannot be avoided).
