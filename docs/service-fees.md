Please email info@mycomedytickets.com if you have any questions about the below.

## Ticket Service Fees

We charge the following service fees per ticket sold:

- Tickets between $.01 than $15: $1.00
- Tickets between $15.01 and $29.99: $2.00
- Tickets between $30.00 and $39.99: $2.50
- Tickets between $40.00 and $59.99: $3.00
- Tickets between $60.00 and 74.99: $3.50
- Tickets greater than $75: 5%

There is no other transaction fees (e.g., credit card processing, seating, venue etc). Everything is included in this amount. 

## (Optional) Payout Service Fees

We do not charge any service fees if you select the option of immediately paying out every order.

However, for shows after Dec 1, 2023, if you select "one-time payment at the end" for a show, Stripe charges 
us a .025% fee, which we will charge back to you. We make no profit off this. This is not a significant fee, some examples:

- $500 payout incurs $1.25
- $1,000 payout incurs $2.50
- $5,000 payout incurs $12.50
- $50,000 payout incurs $125

Of course, you can completely avoid this by just getting paid immediately upon order.
