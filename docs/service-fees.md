# Fees

Please email info@mycomedytickets.com if you have any questions about the below.

## Ticket Service Fees

We charge the following service fees per ticket sold:

- Tickets less than $15: $1.00
- Tickets between $15.01 and $40: $2.00
- Tickets between $40.01 and $50: $2.50
- Tickets between $50.01 and $75: $3.00
- Tickets greater than $75: 5%

There is no other credit card processing fee or other fee. Everything is included in this amount. 

## Payout Service Fees

We do not charge any service fees if you select the option of immediately paying out every order.

However, if you select "one-time payment at the end" for a show, Stripe charges us a .025% fee, which we will
charge back to you. We make no profit off this. This is not a significant fee, some examples:

- $500 payout incurs $1.25
- $1,000 payout incurs $2.50
- $5,000 payout incurs $12.50
- $50,000 payout incurs $125

Of course, you can complete avoid this by just getting paid immediately upon order.
