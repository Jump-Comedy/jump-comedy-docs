# Resending Tickets to Customers

Jump uses Google's delivery service to send transactional email such as tickets. Sometimes email to providers like
hotmail.com, icloud.com and live.com (all owned by Microsoft) goes to a customer's junk mail.

When customers complain about not receiving email, you can now use the app to send them their invoice and tickets.

## How to Send Customers Tickets

Most commonly, you will either have the customer's order number or email from which to go on. You can browse 
orders under the "Orders" menu or use the "Find an Order" feature to find a particular order based on email
or order ID. Once you locate the order, you can click on "Send Customer Tickets" which will immediately send
the tickets again to the customer. 

Alternately, you can choose to click on "Download Tickets" to download the tickets as a PDF and send it yourself.

Options to do either are located from any order listing view, or from the order detail page.
