# Searching for Shows

The search feature is available on the home page of the site. 

You can enter any of the following to find shows:

- Show title
- Show description
- Venue name
- City and province code
- Comics performing at the show

Note that for search results to return based on comic, you must add the comic to the show.

The results will be shown in a dropdown as you type, and will include the show title, city and show times.

## What is the order of the search results?

The search results returned check whether all the query terms exist for a show. If there aren't any results 
found containing all the query terms, it will remove one term at a time, starting from the end of the query
and return results.
