# Tipping Comics

Everyone who signs up gets a profile page whose URL they can customize if they go under "Comic Profile" in the menu.

If they have setup a Stripe account, they are automatically eligible for tipping where anyone can buy them a "drink".
Each drink costs $5.  <a href="https://www.jumpcomedy.com/danquinn" target="_blank">Here is an example</a> of such a page.

## How do visitors tip comics?

When someone clicks "Support" on the comic page, a credit card form pops up and a user can enter their credit card information
to tip the comic. The default is set at two drinks ($10) but the visitor to the page can customize how much they want to give.

## Where does the money go?

The money is immediately deposited into the comic's Stripe account. If you do not have a Stripe account, the "Support" button
will be grayed out.

## Are there any fees?

Yes, Jump witholds the credit card processing cost which is 2.9% plus 30c.

In addition, Jump changes a small service fee ranging between 25 cents to $1:

- Tips less than or equal to $5: 25c
- Tips between $5.01 and $10: 50c
- Tips between $10.01 and $20: 75c
- Tips between $20.01 and higher: $1

## Email notifications

The comic receives an email notification anytime someone has tipped them.
