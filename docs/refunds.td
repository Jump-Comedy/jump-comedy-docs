# Refunds

Refunds can now be issued for both the ticket price, tax and the service fees.

By default, service fees are not refunded. However, you can choose to refund service fees when issuing a refund.

Please note that if you do refund service fees, this amount will be charged back to your Stripe account and will appear
as a separate transaction in your Stripe history.
