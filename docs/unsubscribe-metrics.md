# Unsubscribe Metrics

It is critically important for marketers to keep a close eye on unsubscribe statistics,
especially if you send a lot of campaigns.

## What Unsubscribe Metrics are available?

Currently, there are three metrics available:

1. Total all-time unsubscribes 
2. Unsubscribes in last week
3. Unsubscribes in last month

These are available under Campaigns => Mailing Lists
