# Manage Order Notifications

By default, the person who created the event is sent a notification email on every order for every event.

To change this to an alternate email, go under Account Settings and enter a value for "Alternate Email Order Notification Email".

## Disable Order Notifications at Account Level

To disable this notification, go under Account Settings and select "Do Not Send" for the setting controlling
order sale notifications. The default notification email will no longer be sent.  This will also ignore
anything you set under "Alternate Email Order Notification Email".

## Specifying Alternate Email for Order Notifications for Specific Event

If you have multiple users accessing your account, you can change which user receives the
email by selecting their email under "Advanced Options" from the edit event screen. If you have disabled Account level
notifications, this change will be ignored and no emails will be sent.

## Specifying Additional Emails for Notifications for Specific Events

You can specify other emails to be notified for sales to specific events. These can be configured 
under More -> Notifications for each event. You can add as many emails as you like and an email will be
sent to them for this event for all orders.
