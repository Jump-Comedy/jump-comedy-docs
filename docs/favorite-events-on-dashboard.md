# Starred Events on Dashboard

For users with many events we want to make sure you're able to get to the event you want to manage as quickly as possible.

To help find events faster, you can click the star icon next to each event under Manage Events, and that event will also be shown in
two additional places:

1. Starred tabs under Manage Events
2. On the dashboard (the page you see right after you login)

The dashboard is also accessible from the main menu.

## Star and Unstar Events

Clicking on the star next to an event under Manage Events will star the event. Clicking the star of an already
starred event will remove it as a starred event.  You can also unstar an event right from the dashboard.


## Note on Multi-User Accounts

The star setting is at a user level, not at an account level. So if you star something and have another
user in your account, it will not appear in their starred events.
