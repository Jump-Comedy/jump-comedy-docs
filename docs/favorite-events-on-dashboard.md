# Favorite Events on Dashboard

For users with many events we want to make sure you're able to get to the event you want to manage as quickly as possible.

To help find events faster, you can click the star icon next to each event under Manage Events, and that event will also be shown in
two additional places:

1. Favorites tabs under Manage Evens
2. On the dashboard (the page you see right after you login)

The dashboard is also accessible from the main menu.

## Favorite and Unfavorite Events

Clicking on the star next to an event under Manage Events will favorite the event. Clicking the star of an already
favorited event will remove it as a favorite.  You can also unfavorite an event right from the dashboard.
