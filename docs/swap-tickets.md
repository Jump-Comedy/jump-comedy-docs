# Swap Tickets

If a customer purchases tickets to the wrong show, you can swap those tickets without going through the refund process.

Swap Tickets are available from the order detail page.  You have to provide the following info to swap tickets:

1. Show to swap from
2. Show to swap into

After submitting, the tickets will be swapped and the customer will be emailed a new set of tickets.  The tickets IDs 
will be the same as before. If the customer tries to scan the old tickets, they will not work for the older show.

## Eligibility for swapping tickets

To swap tickets between two shows, the following must be true:

- The order should not have any refunds against it
- The price of the two tickets must be the same
- There should be no assigned seating for either show
- The tickets must not be free (i.e., created using Comp Tickets)
- There must be inventory available in the show being swapped to
- Both events should be in the future
