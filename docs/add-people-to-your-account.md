# Add People to Your Account

If you want other people to manage your Jump account for you, it's easy.

## What Not To Do
You should not send the other party your username or password as that's not a good idea and a huge security risk for you.

## What To Do
Instead, click on your avatar in the top-right corner and select "Users". Click "Add User to Account" and you will be asked
for the other user's email, and what kind of access you'd like to give them.  Note that the other user must already 
have a Jump account with that email.

After you do this, the other person will have access to your shows etc.
